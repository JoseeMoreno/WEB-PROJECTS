    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I was born in the small town of Tecate and lived in different places, which gave me many experiences and memories. Since I was a child, I knew what I wanted to be when I grew up. Iâ€™ve always had a passion for computers and coding. It started with a Nintendo64 when I was 4, a reboot of an old movie about a programmer when I was 7, and finally when I learned Java in high school.</p>
